                :markdown
                    The kill reward module allows a player to get an item when they kill someone. The parameters are wrapped in a `<killreward>` block.
                    So far, the only reward available is an `<item>`.

                    `e.g.` This module can be used to give upgrades to players by giving them gold ingots. Then once they have collected enough ingots they can craft armor, etc.

                    <br/>
                    Example

                        <!-- Kill Reward from Rift XML -->
                        <killreward>
                            <item amount="2">emerald</item>
                        </killreward>
                    
                    The kill reward module can be filtered by adding a `<filter>` tag inside the kill reward module

                    `e.g.` You can use this to give certain team specific kill rewards that only that team can use.

                    Example
                        <!-- Kill Reward from Boombox XML -->
                        <killreward>
                            <filter>
                                <team>defenders</team>
                            </filter>
                            <item amount="8">arrow</item>
                        </killreward>
                        <killreward>
                            <filter>
                                <team>attackers</team>
                            </filter>
                            <item amount="32">snow ball</item>
                        </killreward>
                        
                    ##### [Capture Rule](id:capture_rule)
                    The `<kill-streak>` filter can be used to specify a certain number of kills required to receive the reward, and can accept the attributes: `min`, `max` and `count`
                    
                    * `min` The player must have at least this number of kills to receive the reward.
                    * `max` The player must have at most this number of kills to receive the reward.
                    * `count` The player must have exactly this number of kills to receive the reward.

                    <br/>
                    Example
                        <!-- Kill Reward from U-Boat: KÃ¶nig XML -->
                        <killreward>
                            <kill-streak count="3"/>
                            <item amount="1">golden apple</item>
                        </killreward>
                        <killreward>
                            <kill-streak min="4" max="10"/>
                            <!--  matches players with exactly 7 kills  -->
                            <item amount="1" name="`4Health pack" lore="`7Just in time!" damage="16421">potion</item>
                        </killreward>
